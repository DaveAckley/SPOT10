Software associated with the paper "SPOTs and Spatial Threads", available at [https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/isal_a_00337](https://direct.mit.edu/isal/proceedings/isal2020/32/13/98482)

This is pretty much an unsupported checkpoint dump of the code :(, with my apologies, but if you have up-to-date 'develop' branch MFM and ULAM installed, and you fix the ULAM_BIN_DIR and MFM_BIN_DIR in code/Makefile, there's a *chance* that you could type `make run` and have things build all the way up to a reversing thread demo.  It Could Happen!
