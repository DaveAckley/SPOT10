Wed Jul 15 14:24:29 2020 OK, have a few hours before I have to go
final on the lightning talk details.  Why can't we have a big hack
inner-outer moving scheme to demo?  Full hack!

 - Do we have a mid-priority wall element?  We want something to be
   isContext for the inner thread and isData for the outer thread.

Sat Jul 18 00:55:01 2020 Well, we got walking-while-chewing-gum
working, and the lightning talk came out OK enough, and it's now up
and doing OK-business-by-Dave-Ackley-Channel-standards on youtube.

Committing the changes for the video!
